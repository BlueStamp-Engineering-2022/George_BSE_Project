# Machine Learning Detection Camera
For my project, I used a raspberry pi with a picamera2 to detect objects and eyes. The object detection code draws boxes around different objects and identifies them, all in real time. The eye detection draws circles around any eyes the camera sees, also in real time.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone was getting the program for eye detection on the raspberry pi. I got it to work with the picamera2 instead of a webcam.

# Second Milestone
For my second milestone, I got the eye detection program to work on my laptop. I downloaded various packages that are required for the code to work. I then changed the detection of the code from face detection to just eye detection. I changed the rectangle to a circle to better fit the shape of eyes when identifying them. Finally, I added to the code so that it would stop running when I pressed "q" on my keyboard.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was setting up my raspberry pi and giving it machine learning object detection code from github. I started by setting up the SD card and installing the Raspberry Pi OS operating system. Once that was completed, I inserted the SD card into my Raspberry Pi and connected a monitor, mouse, and keyboard. My Raspberry Pi was set up. Next, I connected the camera. I used the Raspberry Pi terminal to take pictures using the camera. Finally, I found a library on github for object detection. I cloned it and, using the terminal, ran the code on my camera.

# Starter Project
  

On the starter project, I worked with an arduino and a NeoPixel Ring. The Neopixel Ring is made up of 12 individual LEDs. It is connected to the arduino with three wires, and the arduino is connected to my computer so that I can control it with my code. The code allows me to control the ring using the serial monitor. If it type characters b, y, g, m, r, or c, the NeoPixel Ring lights up with the respective colors (blue, yellow, green, magenta, red, cyan).
