# Machine Learning Detection Camera
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was setting up my raspberry pi and giving it machine learning object detection code from github. I started by setting up the SD card and installing the Raspberry Pi OS operating system. Once that was completed, I inserted the SD card into my Raspberry Pi and connected a monitor, mouse, and keyboard. My Raspberry Pi was set up. Next, I connected the camera. I used the Raspberry Pi terminal to take pictures using the camera. Finally, I found a library on github for object detection. I cloned it and, using the terminal, ran the code on my camera.

# Starter Project
  

On the starter project, I worked with an arduino and a NeoPixel Ring. The Neopixel Ring is made up of 12 individual LEDs. It is connected to the arduino with three wires, and the arduino is connected to my computer so that I can control it with my code. The code allows me to control the ring using the serial monitor. If it type characters b, y, g, m, r, or c, the NeoPixel Ring lights up with the respective colors (blue, yellow, green, magenta, red, cyan).
