# Machine Learning Detection Camera
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was setting up my raspberry pi and giving it machine learning object detection code from github. I started by setting up the SD card and installing the Raspberry Pi OS operating system. Once that was completed, I inserted the SD card into my Raspberry Pi and connected a monitor, mouse, and keyboard. My Raspberry Pi was set up. Next, I connected the camera. I used the Raspberry Pi terminal to take pictures using the camera. Finally, I found a library on github for object detection. I cloned it and, using the terminal, ran the code on my camera.
